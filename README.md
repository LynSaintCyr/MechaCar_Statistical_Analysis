1.) Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

 both ground_clearance and vehicle_length provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values hey both have significant to the model.
 
 2.) Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
 
 The slope of the linear model can not be considered to be zero, because the p-value is lower than an extreme level of significance, so the null hypothesis must be rejectected.
 
 3.) Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
 
 Yes, the linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes is effective because the r-squared is 0.7149 meaning that 71% of the variability observed is explained by the regression model.
